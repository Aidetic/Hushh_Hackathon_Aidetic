Gagan: Hey Nayna! Are you coming to Arvind’s birthday next week?
Nayna: Hey Gagan! Yep, planning to! Are you bringing the cake again? 😄
Gagan: Haha, I got tagged for it again! Any flavor suggestions? Last time your chocolate pick was a hit.
Nayna: Let’s try red velvet this time? Also, don’t forget to bring your epic playlist. 😁
Gagan: Deal! Only if you promise to dance this time.
Nayna: No promises, but I’ll try if you start!
Gagan: Challenge accepted. See you there!
Nayna: See you, cake master! 😄
Gagan: By the way, do you know who’s handling decorations? Arvind wants it to be “simple” but you know how these things go.
Nayna: Oh god, “simple” is code for “do all the work but make it look effortless.” I think Bidita was on it, but she asked me for help. We might need you for balloon duty!
Gagan: I have a traumatic history with balloons, but I’ll risk it for the party. 😂
Nayna: I’ll supervise so you don’t tie them all to your own chair this time!
Gagan: Ouch, I thought we agreed to never speak of that again!
Nayna: Sorry, had to! It’s legendary. 😆
Gagan: What’s the plan for gifts? Are we pooling in or going solo?
Nayna: Hmm, I think a group gift would be better. Arvind’s wishlist is like three gadgets I can’t pronounce.
Gagan: Same, he keeps sharing links to things that look like spaceship parts.
Nayna: Maybe something for his music setup? He’s been raving about needing better headphones.
Gagan: Nice! I’ll check on Amazon and drop some options in the group chat. Want to help me shortlist?
Nayna: Sure! Also, remind me to NOT get distracted by deals on stuff I don’t need.
Gagan: Famous last words. 😂
Nayna: How’s your work week going anyway?
Gagan: Crazy, honestly. Too many meetings, not enough cake. 😅
Nayna: I feel you. Let’s just skip to Friday already.
Gagan: Can’t wait. Oh, and after the party, we have to revive game night! It’s been ages.
Nayna: Yesss! I vote for charades or Codenames.
Gagan: I’m unbeatable at Codenames. You sure you want the challenge?
Nayna: Bold claim! We’ll see about that. 😜
Gagan: Also, random question: have you been to that new cafe near Bandra?
Nayna: Not yet! Heard good things. Planning to go?
Gagan: Thinking about it. Maybe we could do a group outing after Arvind’s birthday, or just go and review it for the squad.
Nayna: Sounds fun. Let’s make it happen!
Gagan: So, to recap: red velvet cake, epic playlist, possible balloon injury, group gift, and a follow-up cafe trip?
Nayna: That’s the agenda! Don’t forget, you’re on dance duty too.
Gagan: As long as you join. I’ll even bring my secret moves.
Nayna: Now I’m worried. 😂
Gagan: Don’t be. Worst case, we go viral for the wrong reasons.
Nayna: At least we’d be famous! See you at the party, Gagan!
Gagan: Can’t wait, Nayna. See you!
Gagan: Hey Nayna! Are you coming to Arvind’s birthday next week?
Nayna: Hey Gagan! Yep, planning to. You?
Gagan: Of course! Wouldn’t miss a chance to see you all dressed up. 😉
Nayna: Haha, smooth. But trust me, it’s going to be jeans and a hoodie.
Gagan: You’d still outshine everyone, even in pajamas.
Nayna: Lol, I doubt that, but thanks for the vote of confidence.
Gagan: I just call it like I see it. By the way, what cake flavor should I bring? You get first pick.
Nayna: Red velvet. But only if you promise not to “accidentally” smash it on someone this time.
Gagan: Hey, that was a tactical cake drop! Maybe this year I’ll just save a slice for you and me—private celebration?
Nayna: Don’t get ahead of yourself, Mr. Cake Drop. 😄
Gagan: No harm in hoping, right? Anyway, are you handling the decorations again?
Nayna: Bidita and I are splitting it. She already threatened to cover everything in pink.
Gagan: Pink suits you though. Actually, everything does.
Nayna: Gagan, is this your way of getting out of balloon duty?
Gagan: Caught me! But for you, I’d blow up a hundred balloons. Maybe even spell your name out.
Nayna: Impressive! Though last year you almost fainted after ten. 😂
Gagan: What can I say, you take my breath away.
Nayna: Stop, you’re too much. 😆 But seriously, can you help with snacks? You have good taste.
Gagan: Only if you promise to try my favorite nachos—and let me sit next to you at dinner.
Nayna: Hmmm, only if you don’t start another “who can eat more spice” contest.
Gagan: That’s my signature move! But fine, I’ll behave... at least until dessert.
Nayna: Changing the subject—what’s the gift plan for Arvind? He sent me a list and it’s all super pricey.
Gagan: We can all chip in, but if you want, I can get him something extra just from us. Like a secret mission.
Nayna: Nice try, Mr. Secret Mission. Stick to the group gift.
Gagan: Denied again! You’re tough to impress.
Nayna: You don’t give up, do you?
Gagan: Not when it comes to you.
Nayna: 🙈 Oh god, you’re relentless.
Gagan: Can’t help it, you’re the highlight of every party. Even Arvind’s!
Nayna: Flattery will get you... only snack duty.
Gagan: Worth it if it makes you smile.
Nayna: On a serious note, thanks for the laughs. Work’s been rough this week.
Gagan: Always here for you. And if you need a break, I know a great café—best coffee in town. We could sneak out before the party rush.
Nayna: I’ll think about it. But if I say yes, you better not turn it into another “funny story” for the group chat.
Gagan: My lips are sealed—unless it’s for sharing cake.
Nayna: 😂 You’re impossible. Alright, I should get back to work.
Gagan: Don’t work too hard, superstar. And if you need a distraction, you know where to find me.
Nayna: Will do. See you at the party, Gagan.
Gagan: Counting down the days!
